# Blood-Donation-System
Sem-3 project for python lab.

## Why we built it?
Inspired NIT-Bhopal's drive to raise awareness on the importance of blood donation, this system was built to allow users to easily locate bloodbanks and hospitals where they can choose to donate blood or request for it. 

## My contribution:
I created a database wherein hospitals, bloodbanks, clinics can share their information with the users. This information obtained using a search function.

## Languages and Tools used:
- Python
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Django DB
